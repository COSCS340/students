The goal for this project is to create a town generator for the game Dungeons and Dragons.
The primary use for this tool is to generate citizens of the town, including basic information like their age, height, and when they moved into the town.
There will also be a backstory behind these characters, and we hope to set the tool up to relate some characters to each other. For example, if there is an event like a flood in the town, then several characters will have a backstory related to this event.

A secondary goal for this tool is to procedurally generate a map of the town. This would include buildings and roads, as well as assigning homes to the characters created.

Our group members are as follows:
	Dakota Sanders
	Ben Johnson
	Matt Matto
	Bert Bashford
	
We are unsure as to what languages/software tools we will use for this project.
