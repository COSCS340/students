Hi! My name is Kelsey Veca. I am a junior with a double major in computer science and Spanish. I'm super into hackathons because of the community and learning opportunities they provide. So I travel to a few of those each semester and am on the organizing team for VolHacks. From this class, I'm looking forward to getting some real world practical skills.
