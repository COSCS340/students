I've been programming since I was ~12, and have been using Linux since I was 10.

I primarily program in Python, but also have programmed in:
 * C,C++
 * Shell (sh,bash,zsh,fish)
 * Make, Cmake
 * PHP
 * MySQL
 * HTML, Jade/Pug, CSS, Javascript
 * NodeJS, MongoDB
 * Ruby
 * Java

I've worked at ORNL as a software and systems integration intern for 3 summers and two semesters on the Summit Temperatures project. (The new supercomputer that's watercooled.)

I currently work at ORNL's MDF as a software development intern.

I've used Git and Github extensively over the years and have really enjoyed git over other VCS systems such as svn or mercucial.

I enjoy working with others in a development setting, and have 3-4 years of team work experience using Github/Gitlab as a collaboration method, along with various workflows like Git or Github flow.

I use Linux on all my personal machines and have never bought a Windows license or Apple hardware. If you want to install linux on your machine, I highly recommend it and will be willing to help!
