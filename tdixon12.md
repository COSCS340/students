My name is Trevor Dixon. I am a fifth-year student at UTK who originally majored in Philosophy. However, I ended up getting wrapped up in the formal logic classes I took for my philosophy degree, and became motivated to learn programming. In my 3rd year, I started taking CS courses. After this year, I will graduate with both a BA and BS.
