I am Casey Lemon and currently a Sophomore. During the summer and throughout fall semester, I interned at a local company called Gridsmart where I developed a program to help decrease times spent on various processes throughout their production department. I am interested in a lot of things software so I don't like to "pigeon hole" myself into specific topics, but some specific interests would be probably be machine learning and data analysis.
