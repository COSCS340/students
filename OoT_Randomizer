Title: Zelda OoT Randomiser

Need two more group members

Basic Idea: We plan to make the logic needed to create an item randomiser for Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

The randomiser would mix up the item locations in the game, so that each time you played, it would be a different 
experience. For example, instead of getting a sword out of the first chest like normal, you might get a hookshot
instead. From there, you can start some dungeons that require the hookshot, and maybe you'll find items that lead 
you to a different dungeon in there.

We only plan on making the logic behind the randomiser, and not actually edit the game, however, if we can figure
out how to do that, we will try to implement it. The logic would consist of the user giving the program a starting 
seed (or not, in which case the seed will be randomly generated), and the program will output a text file detailing
where all of the items would be placed. If we are able to edit the game, the user will provide a seed (optional) and
a ROM of the game to be edited. The program will output the same text file as before, and the edited version of the
ROM.

Technology Used: We plan to write the program in C++.
