Howdy cowboy!


My name is Ben I am a senior in computer science and I want to learn more about software engineering.


My interests include riding unicycles, pretending to know how to ride skateboards, amateur radio, and computers.


Now, have a haiku:

Ah, now this should work.
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
Wait. Now what happened?
