Open Source Project Assigment:

Notes 1 and 2 are similar: I need to pick a project that is something I will be interested in. I am interested in anything that is related to video games. I am also interested in pattern and image recognition. I have some experience make simple games and that is also what we are working on this semester for our group project.
Note 3: I kind of already mentioned this but anything game related since that what my team is working on this semester. 
Note 4: I know a lot of programming languages and softwareâ€™s so this note is something I will not be too concerned about.  
Note 5: I was going to mention this anyway if it was not a step. I need to find a project that is relative new or still in the process of being made so it will be a lot easier to find something to make a comment on.
