Overview
We will be creating a software to manage and represent the number of available parking spot in a parking garage.
It is going to most likely be on a webpage connected to a database and can be easily thrown to a future software.

Goals
Create Database for parking garage 
Make it easier for people to know if there are open spots in a garage so they do not waste their time
Make a User friendly interface that allows someone to easily make their decision to use a particular garage

Specifications
Using Visual Studio and other tools to make a webpage with an ASP.NET format along with multiple
languages like C#/Javascript/NodeJS and even Bootstrap for page sizing or using PHP with mysql instead (depending on team skills).
These tools will be used in making a homepage that allows the user to easily check the availability 
of a garage and will be user friendly to even someone with limited skills.
