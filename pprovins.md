I am Preston Provins IV, I am a Junior seeking a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. I have used source control before for large projects; however, I would love to learn how to further my education in group work and source control. My specific interests are Computer Graphics and Networking Solutions for Recreation (i.e. Video Games).
