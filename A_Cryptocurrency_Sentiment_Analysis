Cryptocurrency prices are presumably dictated on some level by the online sentiment associated with any given cryptocurrency. 
The goal of this project is to create a system that can gauge sentiment based on articles collected from the internet
such as tweets or news headlines. To do this, the online articles must be scraped from various websites and stored, 
and then labeled as having positive or negative sentiment. We then could count the number of positive and negative sentiment articles
within a certain time period at which point we should be able to examine the relationship between sentiment
over time for a specific cryptocurrency andits effect on the prices of that cryptocurrency in the same time period.
