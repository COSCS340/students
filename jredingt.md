I am Jonathan Redington, a "junior" majoring in CS.
My interests include the following:
-Video game development with a focus on intelligent design
-Playing games
-Writing code myself because I want to teach myself how it works rather than trusting rando420's libraries off the internet
-Tinkering with that Java game engine I'm still not done with after 7 fresh starts and 4.5 years
-Overanalyzing everything
-Puns. You have now been warned.
