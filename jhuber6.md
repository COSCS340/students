Hello, I am Joseph Huber. I am a senior in Computer Engineering. I am currently interested in high performancce computing and program optimization. I'm interested in researching the usage of FPGAs as external accelerators as well as advanced computer architectures. I have also recently become a fan of Functional Programing and would like to see if functional programming could improve the design process of hardware. I have worked as an intern at Siemens Medical Imagine in Knoxville as well as Oak Ridge National Laboratory. At Siemens I developed a handful of modules in VHDL that will be used in their future PET scanner project as well as hands-on work with electronic devices and their design. At Oak Ridge I investigated paralleliing compilers and helped optimize several programs that were to be run on the Titan Supercomputer. I also published a White Paper detailing the use of SIMD instructions in the OpenMP 4.5 standard. You can read it in pdf format here: https://info.ornl.gov/sites/publications/Files/Pub69214.pdf.
