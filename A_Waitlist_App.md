Team Members: Avie Desai, Naveli Shah, Ben Chesney, Surya Manikonda

Idea: Our team has decided to create an app that will allow users to see all the different restaurants on campus and
check the waiting times for each one. The app will be user-based, so times will be approximately calculated depending
on how many users "check-in" and "check-out" on the app for the particular restaurant.

Technology/Tools: We plan on initially using Xcode to create an iOS app mainly because all members in our team have iPhones so 
it will be best for testing purposes, but we plan to also look into Android development as well based on complexity and time.

Goals/Values: Our goal is to create this app as a simple prototype to allow users to test it and provide feeback. Once users 
see the value of the convenience that is provided and how much time can be saved, we would like to proceed and hopefully publish
for widespread use on campus.
