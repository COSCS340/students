Hello, my name is Zack Strickland. I'm a Computer Science major in my junior year, and a Mathematics major in my senior year (the result of transferring from a community college with no cs studies). This semester, I'm hoping to learn how to efficiently manage, organize, and contribute to large projects, my experience so far being limited to small-scale programming.
