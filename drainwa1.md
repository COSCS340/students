My name is Dylan Rainwater and I am a sophomore Computer Science student at UTK. 
I am a member of the machine learning club but have only been to a few meetings so far. Hoping to change that in the future.
Currently, I am a web developer intern for the university's athletics department. Last summer I interned as an IT intern doing
software development work for CBL in Chattanooga. I am also in a group on campus working to develop a new cryptocurrency.

I am interested in artificial intelligence, software engineering, and blockchain technology. I'm excited to learn some cool
stuff this semester!
